To connect to LND thru rest, it is necessary to PIN the HTTPS certificate and send macaroon data thru the header

The macaroon data must be sent in the header with key "Grpc-Metadata-macaroon" and the value is the output of:

	$ xxd -ps -u -c 1000 ${LN_ROOT}/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/admin.macaroon


The cert fingerprint is generated with:
	
	$ openssl x509 -fingerprint -sha256 -in ${LN_ROOT}/tls.cert -noout
